Howdy! My name is Ander Ortiz and I am a Masters student at the University of Arizona working under the guidance of Dr. Kim Wood. I grew up in South Florida where I became fascinated with hurricanes! Specifically, it was the 2016 hurricane season when I had just entered the 6th grade and I was amazed by the path Hurricane Matthew took, where last minute it went 30 miles directly East, sparing my hometown to even more catastrophic damage. This was further intensified the next year by hurricane Irma and I have been passionate ever since! My current work focuses on how precipitation within tropical cyclones evolve throughout their lifecycles. If all goes well, I'm getting ready to stick around for my PhD and I'm super excited for what my future holds. 

When I am not doing research I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, learning the guitar (acoustic... for now), and going on road trips.
